# Yahoo Stock Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the future stock prices of Yahoo using various time series forecasting models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, RNN, LSTM, and GRU.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is historical stock price data for Yahoo. It contains the date and closing price of the stock for each trading day. The dataset can be obtained from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) or any other reliable source.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the project:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels
- keras
- tensorflow

You can install them using `pip`:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn statsmodels keras tensorflow
```

## Usage

> Place the dataset file (`yahoo_stock.csv`) in the `data/` folder.


## Results

The performance of each model can be evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE). The results of the model evaluation can be found in the Notebook.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of various time series forecasting models for predicting the future stock prices of Yahoo. By comparing the performance of different models, we can determine which model provides the most accurate predictions for this particular dataset.

Feel free to explore and customize the models and experiment with different hyperparameters to further improve the prediction accuracy.
